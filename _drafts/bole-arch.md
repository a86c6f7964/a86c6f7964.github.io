This is my first time trying to write up a design documentation, but there has to be a first time for everything.
I am hoping that it will be a good way to get my thoughts organized.

### Bole
What is in a name? For a while now I started naming things "abstractly" so that they can morph as need be into what they need to become without the distrations of someone trying to understand if the name fits or not. 
Bole is "the trunk of a tree" so it seemed like a good abstract name for something that deals with logs.
